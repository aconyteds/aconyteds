This is the Git hub page for Ian's Website. I will be documenting some of the features available within the API to keep followers up to date on what I am working on. I am adapting an AGILE approach to ensure that I stay on task as far as development goes.

Currently the application is driven by Dojo and JSON. When a user routes to a given page, the application loads the content specified for that route within the JSON files and parses it into display nodes. Currently there is support for a few different types of content, but I plan on instituing the ability to reference a dojo template to allow for more customization.
