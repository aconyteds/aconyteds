I started PC gaming as a young kid when the games came on Disk. I relied on my dad to load things up for me, but I enjoyed playing the simple games of the day. My first real foray into PC games was with the original Diablo and Age of Empires. I also thoroughly enjoyed Command and Conquer, and really got into Red Alert. Over time I kept up with the RPG and RTS genre for the most part. I moved on to play Red Alert 2 and put a ton of hours into Yuri's revengs.

Fist big game I played was Ultima Online. I remember dropping countless hours in that game trying to tame the best dragon and tackle the hardest dungeons. Eventually I got tired of the Gameplay and moved onto other games. Star Wars Galaxies was the next big thing, and I remember my PC barely being able to handle it. I still loved it so much playing as my Wookie. Eventually I opted for a Zabrak TKM/Doctor though, last time I played a Flavor of the Month class that I can remember. City of Heroes was the next game I tried. I really enjoyed it, for the most part. I never got to level cap even after playing it for several months, I just had so much fun making new heroes and all of the different playstyles were so much fun.

I rolled a Druid because, bear. I loved the game world, and even though it only ran at 3FPS, I still played the crap out of it. I started off Alliance but eventually went Horde and got my Mage to cap the same day I graduated High school.

I played the game for a good amount fo time, but got tired and went back to SWG. I actually enjoyed the post NGE enhancements and still thought the Space combat was second to none.

I was starting to get the itch though so I tried Planetside 2. I thoroughly recommend this game if you are interested in FPSs and MMOs like I am. After this I tried Tera, Guild Wars 2, went back to Rift, and WoW; but now I am not playing games from the past. My current focus is WildStar, and I am playing a bunch of others again including Guild Wars 2, The Secret World, Final Fantasy XIV.
