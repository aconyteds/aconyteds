The weight came of slowly but steadily for the first few months. Even over Thanksgiving I was able to lose a bit of weight. I started around August and by January I had lost almost 30 Lbs. I started feeling so good that I decided it might be time to try adding some working out as well. So I ditched Weight Watchers, and just started tracking my calories with My Fitness Pal."

Through a combination of Portion control, exercise, and eating right I lost another 15 pounds in the next 3 months. I started exercising by going to the Gym, but eventually I ended up setting up a workout area in our loft and purchasing GSP Rushfit. This kit was amazing for getting my energy up, toning my body, and imrpoving my overall mobility as well as shed some excess poundage. I lost a pound a week during the 8 week program, and I was able to run a 27 minute 5k to boot. I highly recommend this workout to anyone who is looking to improve their overall fitness."

Given the sucess with Rushfit, I decided to try another home fitness series Body Beast. This kit was designed specifically around building mass. I worked my way through it and definitely could see the gains. The results were not life changing, but they did help me feel like when I say that my weight is pure muscle, I am not totally lying."

I dropped a total of 60 lbs. in a year, and was able to run a 23 minute 5k. It truly was a remarkable experience to not die running up stairs, or actually be able to tucker kids out and still have plenty of energy to keep going afterwards. I have moved on to other programs since then and my weight has fluctuated. I am now not so worried about what the scale says and am focused on making sure that I feel and look good. No matter what anyone tells you, if you are not happy about who is staring back at you in the mirror and there is the drive to get healthy; <b>DO IT!</b>"
