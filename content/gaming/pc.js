There are of course issues and bugs that every MMO has around launch, but it is still an overall good experience. What really helps this game stand out in the currently crowded market is the gameplay. The combat is action oriented and moves pretty quickly. I like the mobility of the classes as well as how fulfilling most abilities are when they land. The game is still in it's infancy, so we'll have to see how it develops."
